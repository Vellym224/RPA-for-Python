RPA PROJECT USING PYTHON
Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is a system that allows businesses to automate processes and tasks that are typically carried out by employees. This system can work across different applications, platforms, and departments. RPA integrates well with the existing IT infrastructure and doesn’t require any additional installations. Companies don’t have to invest heavily to automate essential processes.
